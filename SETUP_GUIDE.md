## üìù Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Google Authentication in Firebase

1. **Open Firebase Console:**
   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your SoSTrack project

2. **Enable Google Sign-In:**
   - Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Click on the "Sign-in method" tab
   - Find "Google" in the list of providers
   - Click on it to expand
   - Toggle the "Enable" switch to ON
   - **Important:** Add your authorized domain:
     - In the "Authorized domains" section
     - Add: `sostrack.vercel.app`
     - If testing locally, `localhost` should already be there
   - Click "Save"

### Step 2: Update Firestore Security Rules

Your Firestore needs to allow the whitelist to be read during login, but protected for writes:

1. Go to **Firestore Database** in Firebase Console
2. Click on the **Rules** tab
3. Update your rules to include:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Special rule for whitelist - readable by anyone during login
    // but only writable by authenticated users
    match /settings/whitelist {
      allow read: if true;  // Anyone can read to check during login
      allow write: if request.auth != null;  // Only authenticated users can modify
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click **Publish**

### Step 3: Test Authentication Locally

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the login flow:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - You should see the login screen
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Sign in with either:
     - donnyp02@gmail.com
     - dgadlin@gmail.com
   - You should be granted access!

3. **Test unauthorized access:**
   - Try signing in with a different Google account
   - You should see: "Access denied" message
   - Perfect! The whitelist is working

### Step 4: Manage Authorized Users

1. **Access the Settings tab:**
   - Once logged in, click the "Settings" tab in the navigation
   - You'll see the "Authorized Users" management panel

2. **Add new users:**
   - Type an email address in the input field
   - Click "Add Email" or press Enter
   - The email is immediately added to Firestore
   - That user can now sign in!

3. **Remove users:**
   - Click the √ó button next to any email
   - Confirm the removal
   - That user will be denied access on their next login attempt
   - **Note:** You cannot remove the last email (safety feature)

### Step 5: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

   Or if using the Vercel dashboard:
   - Push your changes to Git
   - Vercel will auto-deploy

3. **Test production:**
   - Visit https://sostrack.vercel.app
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Everything should work perfectly!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Access denied" even with correct email
- Make sure the email is exactly as listed in Firestore
- Check that Firestore rules allow reading `/settings/whitelist`
- Try logging out and back in

### Can't add emails in Settings tab
- Verify you're signed in with an authorized account
- Check Firestore rules allow writes to `/settings/whitelist` for authenticated users
- Check browser console for errors
